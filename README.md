# Numerical-Analysis

This repository contains codes that were used in the context of the "Computational Physics" course during the Bachelor's degree in Physics offered in the University of Patras. In this course we did numerical analysis and we integrated its ideas in MATLAB

We have codes that are used for:
* *Bisection Method for Root Finding*
* *Newton-Raphson Method for Root Finding*
* *Solve a System of Equations using the Determinant of the Matrix*
* *Solve a System of Equations using the Inverse Matrix*
* *2D (double) interpolation for function approximation*
* *Numerical Computation of the Derivative of a function*
* *4th Order Runge-Kutta for 2x2 systems of equations and integration on White Dwarfs problem*
